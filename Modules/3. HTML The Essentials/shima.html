    <!-- Paragraph describing the bird -->
    <p>
        The <b>shima-enaga </b> is a small, fluffy bird native to Hokkaido, Japan,
        known for its all-white head and face, which gives it the nickname "Japanese
        snow fairy". It is a subspecies of the long-tailed tit and is about 14 cm
        long, including its long tail. Due to its round shape and fluffy feathers,
        especially in winter, it is often described as looking like a ball of cotton.

      unlike other long-tailed tit subspecies which have black streaks on their
      heads. Its overall appearance is small and round, and it can fluff its
      feathers in the cold to stay warm, enhancing its "fluffy" look.
