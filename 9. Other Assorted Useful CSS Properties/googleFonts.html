      <h1>Samoyed</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Samoyeds are a breed of domesticated dog originating from the Siberian
        Arctic, where they were historically bred by the Indigenous Samoyedic
        peoples for herding reindeer, pulling sleds, and providing
        companionship. They are known for their dense, weather-resistant double
        coat, wedge-shaped head, and characteristic “Sammy smile,” which
        prevents drool from freezing in subzero temperatures. Adult Samoyeds
        typically stand 48 to 60 cm (19 to 23.5 in) at the shoulder and weigh
        between 16 and 30 kg (35 to 65 lb).<sup>[3]</sup>Due to their
        intelligence, cooperative nature, and strong social bonds with humans,
        Samoyeds are considered one of the more people-oriented working breeds.
        The name “Samoyed” is derived from the Samoyedic peoples of northern
        Russia and Siberia, with whom the breed developed in close association.
        In English, the word originally referred generally to the peoples of the
        region before becoming associated with the dog breed. Their iconic white
        coat, which ranges from pure white to cream or biscuit, helped them
        blend into snowy landscapes and stay warm during Arctic winters.<sup

      <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The modern Samoyed is found worldwide as a companion and working dog,
        though its ancestral range lies in the harsh climates of Siberia.
        Historically, the breed lived alongside nomadic reindeer-herding
        communities, inhabiting tundra, taiga, and other subarctic environments
        where temperatures frequently dropped below –40 &#8451; (–40
        &#8457;).<sup>[5] </sup> Today, Samoyeds are most common in Europe,
        North America, and Australia, where they are valued both as family pets
        and as participants in activities such as sledding, skijoring, and
        herding trials. Despite their global distribution, Samoyeds retain
        traits necessary for survival in cold climates, including a thick
        insulating coat and high endurance levels. While they can adapt to
        warmer regions, they require careful management to avoid overheating, as
        their physiology was shaped for snowbound landscapes. Responsible
        breeding practices have helped maintain genetic diversity, and the breed
        is not considered threatened. <sup>[6]</sup>

      <h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Coat and Thermoregulation</h3>
      <p>
        Samoyeds possess a dense double coat consisting of a coarse guard layer
        and a soft, wool-like undercoat. This structure insulates them against
        extreme cold and repels moisture, allowing the dogs to remain
        comfortable even while sleeping atop snow.<sup>[7] </sup>The coat sheds
        heavily seasonally, a process that helps regulate temperature throughout
        changing climates. Their fur has also been historically spun into yarn
        due to its warmth and resilience.
      </p>

      <h3>Visual System</h3>
      <p>
        Like other domesticated canines, Samoyeds have binocular vision suited
        to detecting movement and navigating low-light conditions. Their
        almond-shaped eyes, typically brown but occasionally lighter in shade,
        are positioned to give a wide field of view necessary for herding and
        sled pulling. While their color perception is limited relative to
        humans, their night vision and motion sensitivity are exceptionally well
        developed, allowing them to work effectively during long Arctic
        nights.<sup>[8]</sup>
